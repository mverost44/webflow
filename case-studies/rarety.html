                    <p>An accessible marketplace with a focus on promoting sustainability that provides transparency on
                        the brands/designer or stores the shopper is purchasing from.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>After extensive research we gathered a lot of information on mistakes that were made in the past and seeing what
                        current
                        leaders in e-commerce with a focus on sustainability are doing and working on to provide a simpler system that
                        aids in
                        promoting sustainability in fashion for even the simplest consumer. After deep diving on the Good on You app it
                        changed
                        the scope a little as I may have started off to broad. I removed the social network aspect to just a simple
                        profile</p>

                        <h3>Discovery & Research</h3>
                        <p>I discovered that there is a collective focus on ethically sourced and sustainable fashion, which means progress is
                            being made on this wave. A whopping 72% of users shop consignment or vintage when not shopping with brands that are
                            sustainable. Many users cited the websites goodonyou.eco and thegreenlabel.

                            After concluding the surveys, I took design inspiration from apps Grailed, Poshmark, Depop as they were the most
                            recommended. It seems shoppers liked the aspect of a community-based shopping platforms that allow consumers to buy and
                            sell.</p>
